In the shadows of trees
Where were heard only leaves
which were falling through dark
From tremendous oaks

There were rabbits at night
They were haying a high grass.
Shaking with fear they were singing
Ve-ry strange ly-riiiiiics:

- But we do not care
And we do not care
About wolfs and owls (не тяни первое слово)
Even we are scared!
We do important work
When horrendous hours come
we are haying grass
Wizard temerity grass (среднее - речетативом).

Meanwhile oak leaves
Whispered through a foggage;
Near swing moors there were
Dreadful shadows of night.
Stubborn rabbits did work,
Haid a high grass with passion
Out of fear they sang clearer, 
Louder they sang!
