In the shadows of trees
Where were heard only leaves
which were falling through dark
From tremendous oaks

There were rabbits at night
They were haying a high grass.
Shaking with fear they were singing
Ve-ry strange ly-riiiiiics:

- But we do not care
And we do not care
About wolfs and owls (не тяни первое слово)
Even we are scared!
We do important work
When horrendous hours come
we are haying grass
Wizard temerity grass (среднее - речетативом).

Meanwhile oak leaves
Whispered through a foggage;
Near swing moors there were
Dreadful shadows of night.
Stubborn rabbits did work,
Haid a high grass with passion
Out of fear they sang clearly, 
Louder they sang!

- But we do not care,
So we do not care
About wolves and owls
Even we are scared!
We do important work
When horrendous hours come
we are haying grass
Wizard temerity grass 

- So we do not care
And we do not care
We are stubborn rabbits,
We believe in dreams!
Dreaming is being bold 
To do this we behold 
Three tremendous nights
In the wizard grass! 

And we do not care
A-ny - way don't care
We will be as brave
As a lion or two
If we stay the night 
Although we are fright,
We'll get temerity,
And we will not care!!!

- So we do not care
And we do not care
We are stubborn rabbits,
We believe in dreams! 
Dreaming is being bold 
To do this we behold 
Three tremendous nights
Haying wizard grass!
